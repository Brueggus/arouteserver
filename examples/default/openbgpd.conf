# FILTERS

# NO_ADVERTISE usage notes.
# The NO_ADVERTISE well-know community is used here to handle
# filters that span over multiple steps. At first it is added
# to any route, then it is removed as filters conditions are
# satisfied. Finally, if it is still present, it means that
# the route should be discarded.
