# NO_ADVERTISE usage notes.
# The NO_ADVERTISE well-know community is used here to accept
# routes that should be rejected. Those routes are also tagged
# with an additional community in the format 0:<reject_cause>,
# to track the reason why they should have been rejected, and
# they are set with a localpref = 1, to avoid they are preferred
# over other routes.
# This is done in order to keep track of them for debug and
# analysis purposes.
