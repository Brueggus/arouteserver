Usage
=====

The script can be executed via command-line:

  .. code:: bash

    # if cloned from GitHub, from the repository's root directory:
    export PYTHONPATH="`pwd`"
    ./scripts/arouteserver --ip-ver 4

    # if installed using pip:
    arouteserver --ipver-4

It produces the route server configuration and prints it on stdout.
